LearnSpace App

Welcome to LearnSpace, an innovative application designed to assist individuals with diseases such as aphasia or dementia in improving memory and communication through interactive practices and tests.

Project Overview

LearnSpace is developed as a final year project for Barani Institute of Information Technology. The primary objective of this application is to provide support for people experiencing aphasia, a condition affecting language and communication abilities. Our app facilitates memory retention and enhances communication skills through a variety of interactive exercises tailored to different user roles.

Key Features
User Roles: LearnSpace supports three distinct roles:

Doctor: Oversees patient progress and adjusts treatment plans.
Caregiver: Provides support and monitors daily activities.
Patient: Engages in memory-enhancing exercises and receives personalized feedback.
Memory Enhancement: Users participate in structured practices and tests designed to stimulate memory recall and improve cognitive function.

AI Facial Recognition: Utilizes AI technology to assist patients in recognizing people. By simply taking a picture, the app provides information about individuals to aid in social interactions.

The primary goal of LearnSpace is to empower individuals with aphasia to regain confidence in their communication abilities and improve their quality of life. By integrating technology with therapeutic practices, we aim to create a supportive environment for both patients and caregivers.
